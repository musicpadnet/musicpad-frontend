<h3><strong>Our Rules</strong></h3>

<p>We may, but are not obligated to, provide our users with the ability to post and receive messages from other musicpad-listed users or allow you to participate in video or live chats with your friends or other users. If we do, you will not use the messaging system or your username to spam, defame, harass, or do anything we find to be objectionable (which is up to us), including, but not limited to, language that attacks or demeans a group based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status and sexual orientation or gender identity. It is your responsibility to maintain proper etiquette, and we reserve the right to terminate the account for anyone who violates our policies. We also do not monitor any particular chat, but reserve the right to edit, modify, ban, or filter any User-Generated Content or username for any reason. If someone posts something that is offensive or objectionable please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate you. We do not, however, assume any obligation to remove such User-Generated Content.</p>

<p>You may share videos and music that is hosted on a third party website (i.e., Youtube, Soundcloud, etc.) but only if it does not conflict with their terms or any applicable law. You may not, however, share, post or otherwise communicate any content (video, audio, or text) that is unlawful, threatening, violent, pornographic, harassing, obscene, racist, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable. We reserve the right to determine what is objectionable at our sole discretion.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, you agree that you will not:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Infringe on anyone's intellectual property or other legal rights (i.e. invasion of privacy).</li>
  <li>Hack, crack, phish, SQL inject, or otherwise compromise the security of our website or its servers.</li>
  <li>Solicit business, spam, or otherwise use our service for commercial purposes unless expressly authorized by us.</li>
  <li>Defraud or threaten any of our users through any method, whether it be through our website or through another method of communication.</li>
  <li>Create more than one active user account, or create a new user account if we have previously banned, suspended, or otherwise terminated your first user account.</li>
  <li>Harass anyone.</li>
  <li>Impersonate anyone.</li>
  <li>Do anything unlawful or bad (we define what is bad).</li>
</ul>
<p>How we react to your violation of any of these Terms does not mean we will treat everyone the same. We may do anything from yell at you, temporarily suspend your account, ban you, or haul you into Court.</p>

<h3><strong>Sharing Videos and Music</strong></h3>

<p>Musicpad may permit you to share videos and music with your friends. We may also allow you to use video or live chat to discuss the video or music as it is playing. Please note, however, that we do not host any User-Generated Content ourselves. Instead, you must use our platform to share your video or music from the third party video hosting website. You agree that you will be responsible for the User-Generated Content you upload, and that nothing you share will infringe on the rights of anyone. Furthermore, you warrant you have the ability to grant the right to share such User-Generated Content without any obligation to pay any royalties to any copyright owner. You will be responsible for the payment of any royalty and any associated damages, fees, fines or penalties, in the event we find out you have shared User-Generated Content in violation of another’s intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>Not to sound like a broken record, but we have to make sure you understand that you will be responsible for any User-Generated Content that you upload, including the consequences of any infringement. By sharing any User-Generated Content you are, in essence, utilizing a third party license to distribute and share User-Generated Content. You may only do this if the Site from which you are linking has given you a license to share such User-Generated Content in the manner contemplated. If it does not, then you cannot share that User-Generated Content.</p>
<p>For further clarity, you must only distribute videos or music that you are legally permitted to...meaning you cannot share videos or music that violates anyone’s third party intellectual property rights. For example, you must not share anything that the third party site would prohibit. In addition you will not modify, edit, disassemble, or create derivatives of anything that you do not own the rights to.</p>
<p>Should you believe that your rights are being infringed on by, please note that we are not responsible for hosting it and it is the third party site which is serving the file, and until is removed from the third party site, it will still be available through their search engine. As such, copyright notices should be sent to both us and the third party site, and you should visit their terms for more information.</p>

<h3><strong>Update to Terms</strong></h3>
<p>These Terms (or if applicable Additional Terms), in the form posted at the time of your use of the Site to which it applies, shall govern such use (including transactions entered during such use). AS OUR SITE EVOLVES, THE terms of service UNDER WHICH WE OFFER THE SITE MAY PROSPECTIVELY BE MODIFIED AND WE MAY CEASE OFFERING THE SITE UNDER THE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR WHICH THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY OFFERED. ACCORDINGLY, EACH TIME YOU SIGN IN TO OR OTHERWISE USE THE SITE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH US ON THE THEN APPLICABLE terms of service AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF OTHER TERMS BY POSTING THEM ON THE SITE (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITE AFTER SUCH NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE OTHER TERMS FOR YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS. Therefore, you should review the posted terms of Site and any applicable Additional Terms each time you use the Site (at least prior to each transaction or submission). The Additional Terms will be effective as to new use and transactions as of the time that we post them, or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you. However, the Terms (and any applicable Additional Terms) that applied when you previously used the Site will continue to apply to such prior use (i.e., changes and additions are prospective only) unless mutually agreed. In the event any notice to you of new, revised or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs. You should frequently check the home page, your message account and the e-mail you associated with your account for notices, all of which you agree are reasonable manners of providing you notice. You can reject any new, revised or Additional Terms by discontinuing use of the Site and related services.</p>
